        <h2>📜 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As soon as I did
          my first coding tutorial I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life. Coding offers an
          engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my problem-solving skills with complex
          technologies. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged
          passion that only gets more exciting as I learn more.


        </p>

        <p>
           What I lack in experience I make up for in passion for the subject. My discipline to "keep
           grinding" is what I feel separates me from many other people within the tech industry and life.
        </p>
